# Reinforcement Learning Implementation

[中文](README.md)|[English](README.en.md)

This repository is dedicated to implementing the tasks of the renowned book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" (Second Edition, complete draft, November 5, 2017) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto, published by The MIT Press.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to make the theoretical concepts and algorithms presented in the book come alive through practical coding exercises. We aim to enhance the understanding of Reinforcement Learning by developing and exploring various models and techniques described in the book.
